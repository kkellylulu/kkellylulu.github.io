   This is my animation that I created. I went with the same creepy theme as my photoshop/ illustration project and created a scene where the ghost stole the skateboard. It was hard for me to animate the ghost, but I was very satisfied with the results. A very tenacious process, however, it was very rewarding to watch it come to life.
